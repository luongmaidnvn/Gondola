LogiGear was originally a software testing company founded in 1994 but in 2005, to meet our customersâ€™ new demands, we began offering **application development services** for **mobile**, **web** and **desktop applications**, this was the beginning of MOWEDE. To better serve our clients, we decided to formally split into MOWEDE and engage with KIS to offer Application Services for the Asia-Pac region.
