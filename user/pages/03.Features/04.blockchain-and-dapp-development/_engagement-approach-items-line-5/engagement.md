        content: 'We can help you design, organize, run and even automate tests for your decentralized applications, chain-codes, or your whole business Blockchain. The DApp test would include test-net setting up and functional validation whilst the Blockchain for business should be verified on functionality, security and performance as well. Moreover, we can run regression tests using VMs, Docker containers or cloud-based virtualization services such as AWS and Azure. We can also hand off these automated test cases to your test team to perform test execution if need be.'
