        content: "**ORDERING FOOD JUST GOT EASIER WITH NEW MOBILE APP**\r\n\r\nWaiter.com, the premier online restaurant ordering service for the hungry web surfer, pioneered the concept of online restaurant ordering. The company was founded in 1995 by alumni from M.I.T. and Stanford Business Schools with the mission to save customers time by offering takeout or delivery food services from 60 Silicon Valley restaurants. Today, Waiter.com supports over 1300 restaurants nationwide. When an order is placed via Waiter.com, it is sent to the appropriate restaurant, and the customer gets verification that the restaurant has received the order. In addition to confirming the order and resolving any issues quickly, customers can save favorite orders for future use which can reduce order processing time to as little as 2 minutes. Customers can also order ahead and specify a later preparation time to avoid long waits during the busiest hours.\r\n"
